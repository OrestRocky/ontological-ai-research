# Ontology & Philosophy in AI

This lab explores ontological structures in AI systems:

- What does it mean for a machine to "understand"?
- Can AI grasp "being", "self", or "consciousness"?
- How do we model belief, value, and essence in a digital environment?

We use both **symbolic models** and **semantic graphs** to explore these questions in Go and Python.

## Initial Topics
- Essence and Identity Modeling
- Ontological Dualism in Machine Perception
- Digital Representation of Belief
