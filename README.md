# AI Ontology Lab — by Orest Yatskuliak

A research-driven initiative exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Ontology, and Philosophical Logic.

## Mission

This lab investigates **what it means to "know", "exist", and "be"** in the context of machines, data, and consciousness.  
We model **ontological structures**, **belief systems**, and **conceptual hierarchies** using code — as both scientific tools and philosophical inquiries.

## Structure

ontology_core/ # Symbolic Reasoning (Python) philosophy_engine/ # Ontological Graphs (Go) docs/ # Philosophical & technical documentation

## Topics of Study

- Representation of essence, identity, and soul in machine reasoning
- Ontological modeling using symbolic logic and graph-based inference
- Bridging metaphysics, logic, and computation

## Tech Stack

- Python (symbolic AI, reasoning)
- Go (structural modeling, graph theory)
- Jupyter Notebooks (research explorations)
- Markdown / RDF / JSON-LD (ontology formats)
